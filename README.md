# EXECUTOR 
The project manages concurrent program execution and can output the last lines printed by the executed programs. It can also stop running programs.

The command 

cd mw431552 && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

should produce an executable file "executor" in the directory "mw431552/build".

The project is a solution to a university assignment created by Marcin Wrochna. He provided the files err.h, err.c, utils.c, and utils.h.
